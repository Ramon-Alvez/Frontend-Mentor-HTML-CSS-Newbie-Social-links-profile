## My process

Well, I made this project following some steps:

- HTML:
  - First, I analyzed the design and thought about the overall structure of the project;
  - Then, I structured the HTML, separating the divs, creating the main classes and formatting everything.

- CSS:
  - In CSS I started stylizing the main background and centering the card in the middle of the screen;
  - I thought about making my container inside the body to leave the footer and the main inside the container (because I like this style =p);
  - Then I aligned the text in the center, so all the card content would be centered;
  - After that, it's time to organize the "navigation":
    - I started with a structure of list and links, and I made it until the end, the hover worked fine, but when I tested the social link, it just worked when I clicked in the link, not the list. Because of that, I thought to use button, then I remade the nav structure to recive a button inside the link, I stylized the button to take the parameters (and I found it simpler than I did before)

    - Well, I guess there must be a more professional way to do this, but as there are several solutions, this was mine, If anyone sees any form of improvement, I'm glad to hear it.

### What I learned

As I said above, I really struggled with the buttons a bit, but I managed to get to the end on my own :D.
